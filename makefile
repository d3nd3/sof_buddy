# $@ The filename representing the target.
# $% The filename element of an archive member specification.
# $< The filename of the first prerequisite.
# $? The names of all prerequisites that are newer than the target, separated by spaces.
# $^ The filenames of all the prerequisites, separated by spaces. This list has duplicate filenames removed since for most uses, such as # #compiling, copying, etc., duplicates are not wanted.
# $+ Similar to $^, this is the names of all the prerequisites separated by spaces, except that $+ includes duplicates. This variable was #created for specific situations such as arguments to linkers where duplicate values have meaning.
# $* The stem of the target filename. A stem is typically a filename without its suffix. Its use outside of pattern rules is discouraged.
