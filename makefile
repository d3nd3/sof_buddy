# $@ The filename representing the target.
# $% The filename element of an archive member specification.
# $< The filename of the first prerequisite.
# $? The names of all prerequisites that are newer than the target, separated by spaces.
# $^ The filenames of all the prerequisites, separated by spaces. This list has duplicate filenames removed since for most uses, such as # #compiling, copying, etc., duplicates are not wanted.
# $+ Similar to $^, this is the names of all the prerequisites separated by spaces, except that $+ includes duplicates. This variable was #created for specific situations such as arguments to linkers where duplicate values have meaning.
# $* The stem of the target filename. A stem is typically a filename without its suffix. Its use outside of pattern rules is discouraged.

#What -static does: This is a broad, powerful linker flag that acts like a "hammer." 
#It tells the linker: "For every library that follows, attempt to use the static version (.a archive) instead
# of the shared version (linking to a .dll)."
#The Problem: While this correctly forces -lpthread to link the static libpthread.a, it also affects every other
# library linked later on, including the system libraries (-lws2_32, -lwinmm, etc.).
# It essentially tries to pull the code from those libraries directly into your DLL instead of just making your DLL
# call the ws2_32.dll that already exists on the user's Windows system.
#Why this is bad:
#Bloat: Your DLL would become huge because it would contain copies of Windows system functions.
#Instability/Errors: You should always link dynamically against core Windows system DLLs. They are the operating system.
# Attempting to statically link them is incorrect and often fails or produces unstable results.
