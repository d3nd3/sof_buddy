/*
	CVars - Deprecated/Obsolete
	
	This file previously contained centralized cvar declarations for all features.
	CVars have been moved to their respective feature directories:
	
	- src/features/media_timers/cvars.cpp
	- src/features/lighting_blend/cvars.cpp
	- src/features/texture_mapping_min_mag/cvars.cpp
	- src/features/scaled_font/cvars.cpp
	
	Each feature now manages its own cvars locally.
	
	This file is kept for reference but can be deleted once the migration is confirmed working.
