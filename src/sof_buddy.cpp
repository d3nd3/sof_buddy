/*
	DllMain of WSOCK32 library
	Implicit Linking (Static Linking to the Import Library)
	the application is linked with an import library (.lib) file during the build process.
	This import library contains information about the functions and data exported by the .dll.
	When the application starts, the Windows loader automatically loads the .dll specified by the import library.
	If the .dll is not found at runtime, the application will fail to start.

	Before the applicationâ€™s main entry point (e.g., main() or WinMain()) is called, 
	the loader inspects the import table of the executable to determine the required .dll files
	The loader attempts to load each .dll specified in the import table. This includes resolving the addresses 
	of the functions and variables that the application imports from the .dlls.

	Once a .dll is loaded, the loader calls the DllMain function of the .dll (if it exists) with the 
	DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH notification. This allows the .dll to perform any necessary initialization.

	Each library exports the full set of winsock functions.
	SoF.exe [Implicit]-> sof_buddy.dll [Explicit]->sof_plus.dll [Implicit]->native_winsock.dll

	Module Definition File (.def): A module definition file gives you fine-grained control over linking. 
	You can list the specific functions you want to import from a DLL:
	LIBRARY    MyProgram
	EXPORTS
	    MyFunction
	IMPORTS
	    WSOCK32.dll.bind
	    WSOCK32.dll.sendto
	    ; ... (other functions)

	Linker Options: Some linkers might have options to specify individual functions to import.
	__declspec(dllimport) is a storage-class specifier that tells the compiler that a function or object or data type is 
	defined in an external DLL.

	The function or object or data type is exported from a DLL with a corresponding __declspec(dllexport).

	spcl.dll selectively imports:
	  bind
	  sendto
	  recvfrom
	  WSAGetLastError
	  WSASetLastError
	  WSAStartup
	  inet_addr

	 I could had used implicit linking if I had known about it, so if I renamed the wsock.lib file it links to spcl.dll? weird?

	 Initialization Order: 
	   The operating system loader calls the DllMain functions of these DLLs in the order they are loaded.
	   However, this order is not always predictable and can vary depending on factors like the DLL's 
	   dependency graph and loading mechanisms.
